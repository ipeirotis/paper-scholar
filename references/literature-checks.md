# Literature checks: verifying citations and scanning novelty

Use this protocol when the user asks whether a cited work supports a manuscript
claim, whether a stated contribution overlaps prior work, or which source could
support an uncited factual claim.

**Gate condition.** This pass runs only when the environment grants literature
retrieval, a tool that fetches and reads the actual source text (web fetch and
web search, or an equivalent retrieval surface). When retrieval is missing, do
not fake the pass: say so, assert nothing about what any source contains, and
name the missing retrieval access in `Author decisions` and stop. Without retrieval, a citation check is memory, and a memory-cited source is fabrication.
The one thing that survives a missing retrieval surface is the host repo's
verification ledger: past entries there are dated evidence, and reporting them
(clearly dated, never as fresh work) is allowed even when nothing new can be
fetched.

This pass verifies citations and reports novelty leads; it never rewrites the
manuscript's claims on its own conclusion. Its two capabilities ship in one
order, citation verification before novelty scan, because a novelty claim can
only be judged against sources you have actually read.

## The verification standard

One rule governs everything here: never assert unverified substance. A
citation counts as verified only when the source was retrieved and read — in
this session, or in a ledgered earlier one reused under the ledger's rules —
with the passage that supports the use quoted. The protocol below implements
that rule and nothing else; the integrity norms spell out what it excludes.

## The protocol

Run the steps in order. Do not reorder them: the claim inventory is pinned
before the first search, which is what keeps the search a verification instead
of a hunt for a convenient result.

### 1. Inventory the claims to check

Before any search or fetch, list every claim in the requested scope with its
location, split into two groups:

- **Cited claims**: each sentence that attributes a finding, method, or fact to
  a source ("X et al. show Y", "following the approach of Z"), with its citation
  key and the exact wording of what the manuscript says the source supports.
- **Contribution and novelty claims**: each sentence that asserts the paper is
  first, novel, or unlike prior work ("we are the first to", "no prior work
  addresses"), and each uncited "it is well known that" or "prior work has
  shown" claim that names no source.

Resolve each cited claim's key to a real work before you fetch anything: read
the manuscript's bibliography (the `.bib` files it names with `\bibliography{}`
or `\addbibresource{}`, an inline `thebibliography` block, or the reference
list of a non-LaTeX manuscript) so a bare `\cite{key}` maps to a title, venue,
year, and DOI. A key you cannot resolve to a specific work is unverifiable; do
not guess which paper a bare key denotes or search by the key string, since
that risks checking the wrong source.

The inventory must be complete before you fetch a single source, so what you
read can never reshape which claims get checked. Do not add claims to the list
because a search surfaced them, and do not drop a claim because verifying it
looks hard: an unverifiable claim is a reported outcome, not a skipped one.

### 2. Consult the verification ledger

With the inventory pinned, read the host repo's verification ledger
(`literature/verifications.md`) if one exists;
`references/verification-ledger.md` defines the format and the reuse rules.
Mark every inventoried claim whose latest ledger entry still applies (same
claim text, same resolved source) as reused: it keeps its recorded verdict and
date and is not re-fetched. Only the remaining claims go to retrieval. This
step sits after the inventory and before the first search so the ledger can
never reshape which claims are in scope — only which ones need fresh work.

Group the fresh cited claims by distinct resolved source and dispatch one
worker per source under `references/parallel-retrieval.md` when subagents are
available. Give a source worker all claims attached to that work so it retrieves
the text only once. Wait for and validate every citation-source result before
dispatching uncited and novelty searches, one per independent claim or search
question, with the relevant cited-source evidence available to those workers.
This preserves the required citation-before-novelty order while parallelizing
within each stage. The coordinator remains the only ledger writer; without
subagents, execute the same staged units sequentially.

Two version-sweep touchpoints (`references/version-reconciliation.md`)
belong to this step. When the version predicate blocks a reuse — a preprint
or abstract-only read with fuller text possibly available — the `vor` entry
governing that read's baseline (matched by source identity plus the
recorded `version-read` and archived hash) may already hold the archived
fuller text and the evidence passage's new location, turning the forced
retry into a targeted read. And when the ledger holds preprint- or abstract-read entries on
sources outside the current scope, they are not pulled in: offer a version
sweep in `Author decisions` instead.

### 3. Verify each citation

For every cited claim not reused from the ledger, retrieve and read the actual
source (fetch the paper, its abstract, or the specific section that would carry
the claim). Retrieval follows `references/source-archive.md`: resolve the
claim's DOI (or, failing that, its stable public URL), locate a legal
full-text copy, and archive that copy in the project's source store with its
SHA-256 recorded. DOI resolution includes the registrar update check defined
there: a source under retraction, erratum, or expression of concern keeps the
verdict its text earns, but the update is flagged in the citation audit and
`Author decisions` and recorded in the ledger entry. A paywalled source is a
request to the author in `Author decisions`, never a bypass. Judge whether
the source supports the sentence as written, and classify each as one of:

- **supported**: the source states what the manuscript attributes to it; quote
  the passage that supports it
- **partially supported**: the source supports part of the claim as written;
  quote the passage behind the supported part and name the remainder the
  source does not address. Like unsupported, this verdict requires having
  reached the text that would carry the remainder: when only an abstract was
  reachable and it is silent on the rest of the claim, classify the claim as
  unverifiable and note what the reachable text did support — partial
  support is never granted from silence
- **unsupported**: the passage you read states something weaker than, or
  contrary to, the claim; quote what it does say and describe the gap. Reserve
  this for when you reached the text that would carry the claim: a claim missing
  from an abstract you could not read past is unverifiable, not unsupported,
  since most method and result detail lives in the body, and an absence there is
  no evidence against the claim.
- **unverifiable**: the source could not be retrieved (paywalled, not found,
  ambiguous or unresolvable key), or the passage that would settle the claim was
  not reachable (for example only the abstract was available and it neither
  states nor contradicts the claim); say why

### 4. Scan novelty and fill gaps

For each contribution or novelty claim, search for prior or overlapping work and
report leads, not verdicts. A lead names the candidate work and points the
author at what to read ("Doe (2023) appears to address the same problem in a
different setting; read sections 3-4"); it never concludes that the paper is or
is not novel. For an uncited "well known" claim, search for the source that
would support it and offer it as a candidate citation with the passage attached.
When a search returns nothing on point, say so: absence of a found overlap is a
lead too, and it is not proof the claim is novel.

### 5. Update the ledger, then report

Append every fresh verification, every uncited-claim investigation (whether a
candidate was found or the search came up empty), and every novelty scan to
the ledger as dated entries per `references/verification-ledger.md`, and
confirm the writes
landed — on platforms where returning the report ends the turn, an append
promised for afterward never happens. Then return the four sections described
below, naming the files actually written. Mark proposed citation additions and
recalibrated claims as candidates, attach their retrieved sources, and leave
the adoption decision to the author.

## Integrity norms

- **Retrieved, not remembered.** Every source behind a fresh verdict was
  fetched and read in this session, with title, venue, year, and the specific
  passage that bears on the use. The one alternative is a verdict reused from
  the ledger: its evidence was fetched and recorded in an earlier session,
  validated against its archived copy per the reuse rules, and always
  reported with its original date. Model memory is neither of these: a
  citation from memory is treated as fabricated, and a novelty judgment from
  model knowledge is not a finding.
- **Archived, not just linked.** Every source reported on names its locator (a
  DOI cross-checked against its registrar, or a stable public URL with access
  date) and its archived copy in the project's source store — the exact
  evidence legally preserved: the full text when obtainable, otherwise the
  abstract or page snapshot that was read, or quoted passages and metadata
  where redistribution rights require (`references/source-archive.md`). Links
  rot; the archived copy with its hash is what keeps the verification
  auditable later.
- **Reuse is dated.** A verdict reused from the ledger is reported with the
  date it was earned, never presented as fresh work. Novelty scans age
  fastest — the literature moves — so an old scan is a starting point, not a
  current answer.
- **Leads, not verdicts.** A novelty scan returns candidates for the author to
  judge ("X (2023) appears to do Y; read sections 3-4"), never a ruling on the
  paper's contribution. Never rewrite the manuscript's novelty claim on your own
  conclusion: propose the recalibrated claim and cite the evidence, and let the
  author decide whether the overlap is real.
- **Additions are flagged.** A new or changed citation enters the text only as a
  proposed edit with the retrieved source attached, honoring the existing rule
  that citation changes are the author's decision. Never silently insert a key or
  alter an existing one.
- **A recalibrated claim changes the paper.** When the author accepts a novelty
  correction or a new citation, the same claim may echo in the abstract,
  introduction, and discussion: recommend a whole-paper consistency check after the corrections land, and say so in the report.

## Reporting conventions

- **Scope and retrieval:** name the claims checked and which were reused from the ledger, search boundaries, sources fetched and where each was archived, and access failures.
- **Citation audit:** give one row per claim, grouped as supported, partially supported, unsupported, or unverifiable. Name the manuscript location and attach the retrieved evidence; reused rows carry their original verification date.
- **Novelty and source leads:** name each candidate work, the apparent overlap, and what the author should read. A lead is never a novelty verdict.
- **Author decisions:** ask one question per unsupported or unverifiable citation, candidate citation, proposed wording change, and novelty lead. The author decides what enters the manuscript.

# Tasks

Feature tracker for the citation-needed skill. Agents: read this before working
on the repo. New requests go under **Backlog** with the date they were filed;
when work lands, move the item to **Done** with the landing date and the files
that implement it. Items under **Proposed** are ideas awaiting the author's
approval — do not implement them unprompted. Items the author has decided
against move to **Decided, no action** with the decision recorded — do not
reopen them without a new request.

## Done

- **2026-08-16 — Parallel retrieval orchestration.** After the inventory and
  ledger-reuse boundary, citation checks now launch one subagent per distinct
  source (sharing one retrieval across all claims citing it); bibliography
  audits launch one per entry, novelty work one per independent question, and
  version sweeps one per baseline group, up to the platform's worker limit.
  Citation workers finish before novelty and uncited-claim workers begin, so
  later searches can use cited-source evidence; incomplete searches are
  explicitly nonreusable rather than recorded as zero-lead findings. The
  coordinator validates results and exclusively writes the ledger, with a
  documented sequential fallback when subagents are unavailable.
  (`references/parallel-retrieval.md`, `references/literature-checks.md`,
  `references/bibliography-audit.md`, `references/version-reconciliation.md`,
  `references/verification-ledger.md`, `SKILL.md`)

- **2026-08 — Extract the scholar lane from blue-pencil into a standalone
  skill.** Core protocol carried over with blue-pencil couplings removed.
  (`SKILL.md`, `references/literature-checks.md`)
- **2026-08-14 — (a) Repo docs for agents and feature tracking.**
  (`AGENTS.md`, `tasks.md`)
- **2026-08-14 — (b) Archive the full text of every source read.** Cloud
  bucket (GCS/S3) when the project configures one and access verifies;
  otherwise `literature/sources/` in the host repo. SHA-256 recorded per file.
  (`references/source-archive.md`)
- **2026-08-14 — (c) Verifiable locators and the paywall flow.** Every source
  needs a DOI (cross-checked against its registration agency's metadata —
  Crossref, DataCite, or whichever agency issued it) or at minimum a stable
  public URL with access date. Legal open-access copies are searched first
  (publisher, Unpaywall, preprint servers); paywalled sources are requested
  from the author — download the PDF or print the page to PDF and place it in
  the store — never bypassed. (`references/source-archive.md`)
- **2026-08-14 — (d) Dated verification ledger in the host repo.** Results
  stored as append-only dated entries in `literature/verifications.md`, keyed
  by claim-text hash and source identity, with reuse rules so runs never
  redo settled work; pointed to from the host repo's `AGENTS.md`.
  (`references/verification-ledger.md`)

- **2026-08-14 — Rename the skill to chapter-and-verse.** "Give chapter and
  verse" = cite the exact authority for a claim; pairs with blue-pencil's
  idiom naming and avoids the crowded CiteCheck/refchecker namespace. The
  store env var became `LITERATURE_STORE` (rename-proof). Blue-pencil's
  dispatch command was renamed `/paper:scholar` → `/paper:verify-citations`
  (symmetric with `/paper:verify-numbers`). GitHub repo rename to
  `ipeirotis/chapter-and-verse` is done by the owner in repo settings; old
  URLs redirect.

- **2026-08-15 — Rename the skill to citation-needed.** Final name in the
  paper-scholar → chapter-and-verse → citation-needed sequence, superseding
  the chapter-and-verse rename above: the author judged that name hard to
  remember, and "[citation needed]" is the Wikipedia tag every academic
  already knows — resolving it is literally the skill's job. The GitHub repo is
  `ipeirotis/citation-needed` (old URLs redirect). `LITERATURE_STORE` and all
  host-repo artifact paths were already rename-proof; host ledgers written
  under earlier names stay valid, since `maintained-by:` is informational.
  (`SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `tasks.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`,
  `references/verification-ledger.md`)

- **2026-08-15 — Global consistency pass after the slim-out and renames.**
  Aligned the verdict taxonomy — `literature-checks.md` step 3 now defines
  all four verdicts including *partially supported*, which SKILL.md, the
  reporting conventions, the ledger examples, and the reuse rules already
  used — and replaced the leftover blue-pencil framing ("this lane", "the
  master rule") with standalone wording.
  (`references/literature-checks.md`)

- **2026-08-15 — Retraction and erratum check at verification time.** Fresh
  DOI-backed verifications now check the registrar's update relations —
  retractions, errata, corrigenda, expressions of concern; Crossref's update
  metadata incorporates the Retraction Watch database — at DOI resolution,
  flag the update with the verdict in the citation audit and `Author
  decisions`, and record it in the entry's `updates:` field. The reuse-side
  slice had already shipped with the ledger (2026-08-15): reusing a
  DOI-backed entry re-queries the registrar before the old verdict stands.
  (`references/source-archive.md`, `references/literature-checks.md`,
  `references/verification-ledger.md`)

- **2026-08-15 — Bibliography metadata audit.** Fourth capability, approved
  by the author: a cheap standalone pass confirming each bibliography entry
  identifies a real work — its DOI resolved and compared whole-record against
  the registrar per the source-archive tolerance rules, DOI-less entries
  matched by registrar search or their own URL, update relations screened
  along the way. Verdicts confirmed / discrepant / mismatched / unconfirmed
  (registrar absence is a question for the author, never a fabrication
  verdict on its own); results ledgered as `bib:` entries keyed by
  entry-hash; corrections and DOI additions only ever proposed. The trigger
  description now excludes "citation style formatting" rather than all
  BibTeX work. (`references/bibliography-audit.md`, `SKILL.md`,
  `references/verification-ledger.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`)

- **2026-08-16 — Version-of-record reconciliation (proactive half).** Fifth
  capability, approved by the author: a ledger sweep that detects when a
  source read as a preprint or partial text has a published or fuller
  version — registrar preprint relations, arXiv journal-ref, bibliographic
  search, with the update-relations screen along the way — archives the new
  text when legally reachable, diffs it against the archived read at section
  and evidence-passage granularity, and proposes re-checks for claims whose
  evidence changed; intact claims keep their dated verdicts, and no verdict
  ever changes in a sweep. Results ledgered as dated `vor` entries keyed by
  source identity (none-found results stand ~6 months); verification runs
  use the baseline's governing `vor` entry as a bridge when the version
  predicate blocks reuse, and offer the sweep for out-of-scope preprint
  reads instead of pulling them in. The reuse-time slice had already shipped in the ledger
  rules (2026-08-14). (`references/version-reconciliation.md`,
  `references/verification-ledger.md`, `references/literature-checks.md`,
  `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`)

- **2026-08-16 — Machine-readable ledger companion.** Approved by the
  author: an opt-in `companion:` line in the ledger header keeps a derived
  JSONL beside `verifications.md` — one JSON object per entry, `ts`, `type`,
  and `heading` plus keys copied verbatim from the Markdown field labels,
  appended in the same write as every Markdown append and backfilled when
  first enabled. The Markdown stays the record: runs never read the
  companion, and on any disagreement the JSONL is regenerated from the
  Markdown, never the reverse. Without the header line nothing changes —
  the stable field labels keep the Markdown greppable, as before.
  (`references/verification-ledger.md`, `SKILL.md`, `README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`)

- **2026-08-16 — Eval suite.** Approved by the author: fixture manuscripts
  and bibliographies with known-good, known-bad, partially supported, and
  unverifiable citations, exercising the citation audit, the bibliography
  audit, and the uncited-claim investigation. Expected verdicts were pinned
  against the live sources and registrars on 2026-08-16 — never model
  memory — with provenance recorded in `evals/README.md` (including two
  facts memory had wrong: the Snow et al. anthology ID and an empty title
  field in the BERT Crossref record). Runs use the skill-creator eval loop
  (with-skill vs. no-skill baseline, graded assertions on classification
  accuracy, integrity, and the audit trail); results and workspaces stay
  outside the repo. The trigger-description-optimization slice is
  deliberately deferred to the Backlog until behavior settles.
  (`evals/evals.json`, `evals/fixtures/`, `evals/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`)

## Proposed (awaiting approval)

(empty — ideas awaiting the author's approval go here)

## Backlog

- **2026-08-16 — Trigger-description optimization.** The deferred second
  half of the eval-suite item: optimize the `SKILL.md` trigger description
  with the skill-creator description-optimization loop once the skill's
  behavior has settled (three features landed 2026-08-16 alone; let the
  dust clear first).

## Decided, no action

- **2026-08-15 — No blue-pencil sync.** The author decided the behaviors
  landed here (source archive, locator rules, verification ledger, reuse
  rules, retraction screen, bibliography audit) stay standalone: blue-pencil
  is not updated, nothing is upstreamed or downstreamed, and this repo's
  protocol evolves independently from blue-pencil's scholar lane. Divergence
  between the two is accepted, not tracked — the standing sync note in
  `AGENTS.md` was retired accordingly. Closes the 2026-08-15 backlog item.
- **2026-08-15 — Facts-and-figures extraction dropped.** The author decided
  the planned carve-out of blue-pencil's analyst lane into
  `ipeirotis/facts-and-figures` is not needed; the backlog item is closed
  without action. If the idea is revived, it will be tracked in its own
  repo, not here.
